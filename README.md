# Jekyll

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SoftInstigate/jekyll.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SoftInstigate/jekyll)

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license.

This Docker image allows to build Jekyll sites or run Jekyll commands. It also installs Python3 and the AWS cli, in case one needs to deploy to S3 buckets.
